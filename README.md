Quiz Organizer App
This application allows students to take quizzes based on different categories and difficulty levels. 
Users start by entering their name, age, and ID, ensuring valid inputs.
The app then prompts them to choose a category (Math, Science, or History) and a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard).

Questions are loaded from text files, and each quiz session is timed based on the difficulty selected. 
Users can attempt multiple quizzes, and their scores are displayed at the end. 
The app also implements defensive programming to handle invalid inputs and improve user experience.

This project demonstrates strong use of Java concepts like file handling, object-oriented programming, timers, and user input validation.
